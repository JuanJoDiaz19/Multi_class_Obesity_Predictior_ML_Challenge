**Deployed App**: [Obesity Risk Prediction System](https://multiclaappbesitypredictiormlchallenge-eumxalnbahyypmgrmzncdf.streamlit.app/)

## Project Overview

In this challenge, I selected Project 1, which involves a dataset containing detailed information about various patients' health, such as height, weight, number of meals, and more. I developed an **Obesity Risk Prediction System** using a neural network to assess an individual's likelihood of obesity based on personal, lifestyle, and dietary factors. 

By inputting data such as age, height, weight, eating habits, physical activity, and other relevant characteristics, the model generates a prediction that helps identify the risk of obesity.

## Model Performance

The model was evaluated using several performance metrics, achieving the following results:

- **Accuracy**: 0.9893
- **Kappa**: 0.9875
- **Precision**: 0.9893
- **F1-Score**: 0.9893

## Dataset

The model was trained using data from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2/data?select=train.csv).

## Application

The application is built with Streamlit and deployed on Streamlit Cloud, making it accessible to users worldwide.
