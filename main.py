By inputting data such as age, height, weight, eating habits, physical activity, and other relevant characteristics, the model generates a prediction that helps identify the risk of obesity. This tool can be used for early detection and prevention, enabling users to make informed decisions about their health and lifestyle.")

st.write("""### **Inputs:**
- **Age:** Numerical value representing the person's age.
- **Height and Weight:** Numerical values used to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a key indicator in obesity prediction.
- **FCVC (Frequency of Consumption of Vegetables):** Average frequency of vegetable intake.
- **NCP (Number of Main Meals per Day):** Indicates how often the person eats full meals each day.
- **CAEC (Consumption of Food Between Meals):** Indicates whether the person frequently eats between main meals.
- **CH2O (Daily Water Consumption):** Amount of water consumed daily.
- **FAF (Physical Activity Frequency per Week):** How often the person engages in physical activity each week.
- **TUE (Time Using Technology Devices per Day):** Average daily time spent using electronic devices, which might indicate sedentary behavior.
- **CALC (Alcohol Consumption Frequency):** Frequency of alcohol consumption.
- **MTRANS (Primary Mode of Transportation):** Indicates the primary mode of transportation, which could affect physical activity levels.
- **Gender_Female:** Boolean value indicating the gender of the individual.
- **Family History of Overweight:** Boolean value indicating whether there is a family history of overweight/obesity.
- **FAVC (Frequent Consumption of High-Calorie Food):** Boolean value indicating if the person frequently consumes high-calorie foods.
- **SMOKE:** Boolean value indicating if the person smokes.
